## 🎯 **Next Session Prompt**

**"Now that we have a user feedback system collecting data in Supabase, let's create the admin feedback management interface. We need to:**

1. **Add a feedback section to the admin panel** where you can view all user submissions
2. **Create a feedback dashboard** with statistics (average rating, submission trends, status breakdown)
3. **Implement feedback management features** - mark as reviewed/actioned, filter by status/rating, and export functionality
4. **Add feedback analytics** to help prioritize improvements based on user input

**Which admin module should we start with to integrate the feedback management interface?"**
