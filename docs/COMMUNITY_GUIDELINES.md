## 🏘️ For Community Members

### Writing Helpful Reviews
A great review helps your neighbors make informed decisions:

```
"Maria's Plumbing responded within 2 hours for our emergency leak. 
They were professional, explained the issue clearly, and the $250 
repair has held up perfectly for 6 months. Highly recommend for 
urgent plumbing needs in the Downtown area."

scheduling issue and have improved our booking system to prevent 
this. We'd appreciate the opportunity to make this right."

## ⚖️ Conflict Resolution
