## 🎯 Next Session Prompt

**Priority: Implement Real-time Contractor Count Updates & Polish Filter Interactions**

Now that we have a polished Material Design contractor details modal, we need to ensure the main interface provides accurate, real-time feedback to users. The contractor count display should update dynamically across all user interactions, and the filter system needs final polish for a seamless experience.

**Key tasks for next session:**
1. **Ensure contractor count updates in real-time** when:
   - Filters are applied/cleared
   - Search is performed  
   - Favorites are toggled
   - Contractors are loaded initially

2. **Polish filter interactions**:
   - Verify filter badge updates correctly on bottom navigation
   - Ensure active filter state is properly reflected across all views
   - Test filter persistence when switching between list and map views

3. **Optimize mobile experience**:
   - Smooth transitions between bottom navigation tabs
   - Proper loading states for all views
   - Touch-friendly filter panel interactions

**Starting point:** The contractor count element exists in the UI but needs comprehensive real-time updating logic. Filter system is functional but requires final polish for consistency.

**Goal:** Users see accurate, live-updating contractor counts and enjoy a seamless filtering experience across all navigation states and interactions.
