## 🎯 **Next Session Prompt**

**"The Community Trade Network app is now running cleanly in production mode with all debug logging removed. Let's conduct a comprehensive **final testing and optimization session** to ensure everything is working perfectly:**

1. **Test all user workflows** to verify no functionality was broken during the cleanup
2. **Performance audit** to identify any remaining optimizations needed
3. **Cross-browser testing** to ensure consistent behavior
4. **Mobile responsiveness verification** across different devices
5. **PWA functionality testing** including offline capabilities and installation

**Which specific area should we start testing first to ensure the app is completely production-ready?"**
