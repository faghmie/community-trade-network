## 🎯 Next Session Prompt

**Priority: Implement Contractor Count Live Updates & Polish Filter Interactions**

Now that we have a clean interface with the contractor count subtitle, we need to ensure it updates in real-time across all user interactions and polish the filter experience.

**Key tasks for next session:**
1. **Ensure contractor count updates** when:
   - Filters are applied/cleared
   - Search is performed  
   - Favorites are toggled
   - Contractors are loaded initially

2. **Polish filter interactions**:
   - Verify filter badge updates correctly on bottom navigation
   - Ensure active filter state is properly reflected
   - Test filter persistence across view changes

3. **Optimize mobile experience**:
   - Smooth transitions between bottom navigation tabs
   - Proper loading states for all views
   - Touch-friendly interactions throughout

**Starting point:** The contractor count element exists and displays, but needs comprehensive real-time updating. Filter system is functional but needs final polish.

**Goal:** Users see accurate, live-updating contractor counts and enjoy a seamless filtering experience across all navigation states.
