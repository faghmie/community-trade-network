## 🎉 High-Level Achievement Summary

**Successfully implemented a complete end-to-end review submission and moderation system** that ensures data integrity and professional workflow management. The system now properly separates user submissions from public visibility through an admin approval process, preventing unvetted content from affecting contractor ratings while maintaining a seamless user experience.

## 🎯 Next Session Prompt

**"The review submission and moderation system is now fully operational with proper data integrity controls. Let's conduct comprehensive end-to-end testing of the complete workflow: verify that users can submit reviews through the modal system, ensure reviews persist with 'pending' status, test the admin moderation interface for approving/rejecting reviews, confirm that only approved reviews affect contractor statistics and visibility, and validate that all UI updates propagate correctly between interfaces. Let's also test edge cases like duplicate submissions, empty reviews, and verify the statistics dashboard updates in real-time."**
