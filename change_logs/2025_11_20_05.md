## 🎯 **Next Session Prompt**

**"The contractor review app now has a modern, clean clickable card UX with progressive disclosure. The high priority is to complete the user feedback system by implementing the admin section to view user feedback submissions.**

**Let's start by:**
1. **Creating the admin feedback management interface** in `admin.html`
2. **Implementing the feedback data display and filtering** in the admin panel
3. **Adding feedback status management** (read/unread, archived)
4. **Ensuring the feedback system is fully integrated with the existing admin authentication**

**Should we begin with extending the admin interface to include a feedback management section?"**
