## 🎯 High-Level Summary

Successfully resolved the contractor information display issue in the review moderation tab by identifying and fixing field naming inconsistencies between the database schema and frontend code. The problem was that reviews used `contractor_id` (with underscore) while the admin interface was looking for `contractorId` (camelCase).

- **Fixed contractor ID field naming**: Changed from `review.contractorId` to `review.contractor_id` throughout the file
