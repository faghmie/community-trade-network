## 🎉 **High-Level Achievement Summary**

**Successfully transformed the modal system from HTML-dependent to fully independent components** that create their own UI dynamically. The complex event-driven architecture was simplified to direct component communication, eliminating multiple layers of callback forwarding. The Material Design styling was corrected to use consistent surface colors, creating a cohesive visual experience across all components.
