```

## 🚨 **CURRENT ISSUES RESOLVED**

### **FIXED IN THIS SESSION**
1. **✅ LazyLoader initialization error** - Fixed callback naming conflicts
2. **✅ HTML dependency issues** - Modals now create themselves dynamically
3. **✅ Admin/main page compatibility** - Independent modals work everywhere
4. **✅ Professional UI design** - Unified contractor details with admin styling

## 🎯 **READY FOR NEXT SESSION**

### **PURPOSE FOR NEXT SESSION PROMPT:**

**"Let's complete the modal system transition by testing the independent modal functionality, ensuring the 'Leave Review' button works correctly from both contractor cards and contractor details modal, and verifying that the review submission flow integrates properly with the data layer. We should also test the modal system on both main page and admin page to confirm the independence works as expected."**

### **SPECIFIC TESTING FOCUS:**
1. **Contractor card clicks** → Contractor details modal opens (independent creation)
2. **'Leave Review' button** on cards → Review modal opens (independent creation)
3. **'Leave Review' button** in contractor details → Review modal opens
4. **Review form submission** → Data persistence and UI updates
5. **Cross-page compatibility** - Test on both main page and admin page

### **SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
- ✅ Modals create themselves without HTML dependencies
- ✅ All button actions work correctly
- ✅ Review data persists and updates UI
- ✅ Consistent behavior across all pages
- ✅ No console errors during modal operations

The foundation is now solid with independent, portable modal components that can be used anywhere in the application without HTML setup requirements!
