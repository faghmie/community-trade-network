## 🎯 Next Session Prompt

**Priority: Fix Star Rating Interactions & Visual Consistency**

The review modal overhaul is nearly complete, but critical functionality is missing. The star rating system for category ratings is not responding to clicks, and there's visual inconsistency between the overall rating stars and category rating stars.

**Key tasks for next session:**
1. **Fix star rating click functionality** for category ratings
2. **Ensure consistent star styling** between overall and category ratings
3. **Verify visual feedback** works for all star interactions
4. **Test form submission** with various rating combinations

**Starting point:** The review modal structure is complete with Material Design styling, but the interactive star rating functionality for category ratings is broken and visual consistency needs improvement.

**Goal:** Users can reliably click and select ratings for all categories with consistent visual feedback, ensuring the review submission process works seamlessly across all rating types.
