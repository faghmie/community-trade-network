## 🎯 Next Session Prompt

**"Let's implement real-time data synchronization features and enhance the admin dashboard with live updates. Focus on adding WebSocket connections for instant data updates across admin sessions, implementing push notifications for new review submissions, and creating a real-time sync status indicator in the admin interface. Also, add bulk operations for contractors and reviews management."**
